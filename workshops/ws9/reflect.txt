Reflection:

the main lesson of this workshop was threads. I learned to divide the task between two separate threads. in the case 
of this workshop, one thread processed the first half of the array while the other one was responsible for the second 
half. the other part of this workshop was writing and reading a set of characters from a file in binary mode. this workshop
wasn't so difficult, and it didn't take too long to complete since the major part of the code was supplied.
why was necessary to use binary files in this workshop and how did you use them?
I think we used binary files because it is easier and more efficient when it comes to large amount of data. when the data is
a text and there are no delimiteres and no need for us to extract different bits of it. I used fstream object and passed to it
std::ios::binary as a parameter for instance, fstream theFile(file, std::ios::out|std::ios::binary);
why would be important to bind a function to its arguments, and how was it useful in this workshop?
it is useful and efficient when that function with those parameters are repeated multiple times throughout the code.
it makes it simpler and more readable.
the advantages of using multiple threads, and how did you accomplished multi-threading in this workshop.
it makes the project work faster, because it divides the tasks between different threads that can run
simultaneously. As I mentioned, I accomplished multi-threading splitting the task into two threads. one
worked with the first half of the array, and the other worked with the other half.
