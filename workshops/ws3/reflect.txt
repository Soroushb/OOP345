Reflection:

the main lesson of this workshop was class templates. I learned how to design and implement them, how to derive 
another templated class from it and most importantly, how to specialize member functions of templated classes
to do a particular thing. I did not have any difficulty doing part 1 of the workshop, however, I struggled a lot
to figure out part 2. For instance it took me a while to find out how to overload += operator in Parisummable 
class. Eventually I used the constructor with two parameters to add the parameter value to the current value. 
Specialization was particularly difficult for me. I had to reread the notes and use hints to understand them. 
The reason that we specialized operator+=() was because if the parameters are of string type,
we will need a different format than the generic one. we specialized it to have a comma between 
values. The reason for specializing the initial value for summation because the initial values 
are different for different data types. for example if the data is of string type, the initial 
value would be an empty string. However, if the data type is an integer, we initialize it to 0.
We also define static class variables outside the class definition so that they are visible to all scopes.
