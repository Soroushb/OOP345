reflection:

This was the last and the most complex milestone of the final project. 
One of the most important things that I learned specifically in this project was getting the input from a 
text file, and separating its content properly and storing them in our class variables. this task in particular,
was the most frustrating part, even though it didn't seem to bother my classmates as much. the second important 
thing that I learned was vectors, which I really like and enjoy playing around with. A major part of this project
was using STL libraries and iterators, which I found to be very efficient and easy to use. Apart from these,
the rest of the project focused on practicing what we learned through this course. I also learned that sometimes
there might be some instructions missing in the requirements where we should use our own logic to be able to solve problems
like in this milestone. On the whole, I found this project very complex but extremely helpful.
